The m-v-c pattern with node.js using express.js and CouchBase

The view has the role of showing what is needed from the model of data or how to represent the data.
Here I created an HTML table which is fed from the model data after being altered from controller.

The model is the data being received from the kokos.pl API, then is stored in the couchBase db as JSON
files.

The controller glues the model and viewer togather and and notifies them when there has been user interaction
for the model to update its data and view to render an updated view.
